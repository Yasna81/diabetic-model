# diabetic-model
a model that can predict the risk of having diabetes in patients based on various health factors.

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict whether an individual is at risk of diabetes based on various health factors.

## Description

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on a set of health-related inputs. The model was trained on [] and can be used to predict the risk of diabetes for new inputs.
